## Introducing Google Cloud Platform

# GCP Regions and Zones 

- Multi-Region (Europe) >> Region (europe-west2) >> Zone (europe-west2a, europe-west2b, europe-west2c)
- Zone: deployment area for GCP resources
    NOTE: Zone not necessarily corresponds to single physical building
  - Zones grouped into regions <5ms round trip between zones within region
  zone == single failure domain within a region
  25 Cloud Regions
  76 Zones Regions



## Getting Started with GCP
## 


# GCP Resource Heirarchy

Org Node > Folders > Projects > Resources

NOTE: Policies can be defined at any level (or even individual resource i.e. buckets)
  - Policies are inherited downward


All GCP Services associated with a project.
    - resource belongs to exactly 1 project
    - projects can have different owners and users (billed / managed separately)


    Project ID              Project Name          Project Number
    ----------             ---------------        ---------------
 - Globally unique        - Not unique            - Globally unique
 - Chosen by user         - Chosen by user        - Assigned by GCP
 - Immutable              - Mutable               - Immutable 


- Folders group projects
- Folders can contain project or other folders / both
- Use folders to assign policies
NOTE:  Resources in folder inherit IAM policies from folder

- Folders need an Org Node at top of heirarchy 

Organization Node is Root Node for Google Cloud Resources

Main Roles of Organization Node:
  - Organization Policy Administrator:  Broad Control over all cloud resources
  - Project Creator:  Fine grained control of project creation 


GCP project will belong to Organization Node of G-Suite Domain customers

IAM Resource Heirarchy 
  - Policy set on a resource 
      - Each policy contains set of roles and role members
  - Resources inhereit policies from parent
      - Resources policies are a union of parent and resource
  - A less restrictive parent policy overrides a more restrictive resource policy

NOTE: Policies at higher level can't take away access at lower level 



# IAM: Identity and Access Management

IAM: who can take action on specific resources 

Who  <--->   Can Do What  <--->   On Which Resource


Who:  Google Account, Google Group, Service Account, G-Suite, Cloud Identity Domain

Can Do Whan:  IAM Role, collection of permissions
    Permissions grouped together into Role


3 Types of Roles:
  - Primitive 
      - apply to project and affect all resources in that project
      Primitive Roles:
          - Owner    >> manage roles / perms on resource, setup billing
          - Editor   >> change state
          - Viewer   >> view
          - Billing Admin
          NOTE: Project can have multiple owners, editors, viewers, bill admin

  - Pre-defined
      - apply to GCP service in a project 

  - Custom
    NOTE: Custom roles can only be used at project or org level, NOT folder level 



# IAM Roles

  - Custom
    NOTE: Custom roles can only be used at project or org level, NOT folder level 

 Service Account:  control server to server interaction 
    - provide identity for server-to-server interatction in project
    - used to authenticate from one service to another
    - control privileges used by resources
    - Identified w/ email address
        PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
        PROJECT_ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
    - use crypto keys to access resources
i.e.  
  VM to write to cloud storage (use service acct)

  NOTE: Google manages keys for Compute Engine and App Engine

  - Can assing predefined or custom IAM role to service account

  Identity              IAM Role                    Resource
  Service Account     InstanceAdmin Role          Compute Instance

Service Account also a resource

- Different groups of VMs can be granted different identities
- Can change perms of service account without recreating VM
