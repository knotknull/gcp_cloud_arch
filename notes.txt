## Introducing Google Cloud Platform

## GCP Regions and Zones 

- Multi-Region (Europe) >> Region (europe-west2) >> Zone (europe-west2a, europe-west2b, europe-west2c)
- Zone: deployment area for GCP resources
    NOTE: Zone not necessarily corresponds to single physical building
  - Zones grouped into regions <5ms round trip between zones within region
  zone == single failure domain within a region
  25 Cloud Regions
  76 Zones Regions

## Getting Started with GCP


## GCP Resource Heirarchy

Org Node > Folders > Projects > Resources

NOTE: Policies can be defined at any level (or even individual resource i.e. buckets)
  - Policies are inherited downward


All GCP Services associated with a project.
    - resource belongs to exactly 1 project
    - projects can have different owners and users (billed / managed separately)


    Project ID              Project Name          Project Number
    ----------             ---------------        ---------------
 - Globally unique        - Not unique            - Globally unique
 - Chosen by user         - Chosen by user        - Assigned by GCP
 - Immutable              - Mutable               - Immutable 


- Folders group projects
- Folders can contain project or other folders / both
- Use folders to assign policies
NOTE:  Resources in folder inherit IAM policies from folder

- Folders need an Org Node at top of heirarchy 

Organization Node is Root Node for Google Cloud Resources

Main Roles of Organization Node:
  - Organization Policy Administrator:  Broad Control over all cloud resources
  - Project Creator:  Fine grained control of project creation 


GCP project will belong to Organization Node of G-Suite Domain customers

IAM Resource Heirarchy 
  - Policy set on a resource 
      - Each policy contains set of roles and role members
  - Resources inhereit policies from parent
      - Resources policies are a union of parent and resource
  - A less restrictive parent policy overrides a more restrictive resource policy

NOTE: Policies at higher level can't take away access at lower level 



## IAM: Identity and Access Management

IAM: who can take action on specific resources 

Who  <--->   Can Do What  <--->   On Which Resource


Who:  Google Account, Google Group, Service Account, G-Suite, Cloud Identity Domain

Can Do What:  IAM Role =  collection of permissions
    Permissions grouped together into Role


3 Types of Roles:
  - Primitive 
      - apply to project and affect all resources in that project
      Primitive Roles:
          - Owner    >> manage roles / perms on resource, remove members, delete projects, setup billing
          - Editor   >> change state: deploy apps, modify code, configure services
          - Viewer   >> view
          - Billing Admin
          NOTE: Project can have multiple owners, editors, viewers, bill admin

  - Pre-defined
      - apply to GCP service in a project 

  - Custom
    NOTE: Custom roles can only be used at project or org level, NOT folder level 



## IAM Roles

  - Custom
    NOTE: Custom roles can only be used at project or org level, NOT folder level 

 Service Account:  control server to server interaction 
    - provide identity for server-to-server interatction in project
    - used to authenticate from one service to another
    - control privileges used by resources
    - Identified w/ email address
        PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
        PROJECT_ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
    - use crypto keys to access resources
    i.e.  
        VM to write to cloud storage (use service acct)
        NOTE: Google manages keys for Compute Engine and App Engine

    - Can assign predefined or custom IAM role to service account

  Identity              IAM Role                    Resource
  -------------------     ----------------------         -------------------
  | Service Account | ->> | InstanceAdmin Role | ->>     |Compute Instance |
  -------------------     ----------------------         -------------------
NOTE: Service Account authenticate using keys 
      Can assign predefinted / custom IARM Roles to Service Account

Service Account also a resource

- Different groups of VMs can be granted different identities
- Can change perms of service account without recreating VM


## Interacting with GCP
  - Console 
      - Web-based admin UI
      - Manage / Create projects
      - Access to GCP APIs
      - Access to Cloud Shell
         - temp VM w/ Google Cloud SDK installed

  - Cloud Shell / SDK 
      - CLI for Cloud Platform products and services
          - gcloud, gsutil (Cloud Storage), bq (BigQuery)
    NOTE: Can install Cloud SDK on other computers, laptop, etc. 
          Available as a docker image

  - Mobile App
      - Examine and manage resources in GCP 
      - Build dashboards

  - REST
      - Programmatic acess to products and services 
          - Typically use JSON as interchange format
          - Use OAuth 2.0 for auth / auth

      - Enabled through the GCP Console
        NOTE: GCP Console can turn on / off APIs 
          
      - Most APIs include daily quoats and rates (limits) 
            - Can be raised by request
          
      - Experiment via API Explorer
            - Interactive tools to try APIs

Control GCP resource with client libraries:
    - Cloud Client Libraries
        - Community owned libraries 
    - Google API  Client Libraries
        - Open source, generated
        - Languages: Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, .Net, Go, Node.js, Ruby, Objective-C, Dart

- Create with:
  - GCP Console
  - gcloud CLI
- Run Linux / Windows Server
- Can create custom VM
- Pick GPU

Persistent storage:
  - Standard
  - SSD
     - Local SSD for scratch space (ephemeral storage)

## VPC Capabilities 

VPC have routing tables
  - forward traffic within network
      - across subnets
      - between GCP zones
      - no external IP address required
  - built-in

VPC provide global distributed firewall
  - firewall rules via metadata tags on compute engine instance
     i.e. traffic for 80 / 443 can route to compute engines tagged with "web"

VPC belongs to Project
  - VPC Peering allows traffic between two VPCs in different projects
  - Shared VPC: utilize IAM to control what is shared between VPCs

Cloud Load Balancing
  - HTTP / HTTPS / TCP / SSL / UDP
  - single anycast IP fronts all backend instances
  - traffic goes over Google backbone
  - Cross region load balancing
  - Multi-region fail over

## Storage in the Cloud


## Cloud Storage
  - binary large object storage
    - high performance 
    - simple admin / no capacity management

 - key is URL to storage
 - not a file system
 - made of buckets
 - Objects are Immutable
    - Can turn on object versioning

 - Data encrypted at rest / encrypted in transit via HTTPS


Buckets:
  - globally unique name
  - specify geographic area where stored
  - default storage class (?)

  - IAM Policies / Access Control Lists
        ACL:  Scope + permissions



## Cloud Storage Classes

  Mult-regional: high performance 
                 costs more
                 geo redundant: 
                    broad location (US  or EU)
                    two copies at least 160km apart 
                 frequently accessed data: website, etc.
                 SLA: 99.95%

  Regional     : high performance 
                 specific GCP region (US-Central-1, etc.)
                 cheaper than multi-regional 
                 less redundancy
                 used to store data near GCE or GKE
                 SLA: 99.90%

  Nearline:   backup 
              SLA: 99.00%
              low cost 
              infrequently accessed data / 1x per mo. or less
              SLA: 99.00%

  Coldline:   archival 
              SLA: 99.00%
              low cost / highly durable 
              data archiving / online backup / DR
              infrequently accessed data / 1x per yr or less
